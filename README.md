* **2017-09-07**: NVIDIA Redtail project is released as an open source project.

  Source code, pre-trained models as well as detailed build and test instructions are released on GitHub.

* **2017-07-26**: migrated code and scripts to [JetPack 3.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) with [TensorRT 2.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt).
  
    TensorRT 2.1 provides significant improvements in DNN inference performance as well as new features and bug fixes. This is a breaking change which requires re-flashing Jetson with JetPack 3.1.
